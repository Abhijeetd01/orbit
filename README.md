[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20by-Protocol%20Labs-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://ipn.io)

> A distributed, peer-to-peer chat application built on [IPFS](http://ipfs.io)

**NOTE!** *Currently only the Electron (Desktop) version works. We're working to fix the Browser version (js-ipfs)*

## Project Status

**Status:** *In active development*

**NOTE!** *Orbit is still more or less experimental. Things will change and break over the coming months, but we're pushing towards to stabilize the code base. If you come across problems, it would help greatly to open issues so that we can fix them as quickly as possible.*

Check the project's [roadmap](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to see what's happening at the moment and what's planned next.

## Run

Orbit can be run either in a browser or as a native desktop application. The browser application uses [js-ipfs](http://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) implementation of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io). The desktop version uses the [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) implementation of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) together with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

***Please note that Orbit is not secure at the moment!***

### Live Demo

[http://orbit.libp2p.io/](http://orbit.libp2p.io)

*The live demo is an old version of Orbit. It is recommended to follow the instructions below to run the latest version.*

### Desktop

```
git clone https://github.com/haadcode/orbit.git
cd orbit
npm install
npm start
```

### Browser

*Chrome is recommended to run Orbit in the browser.*

```
git clone https://github.com/haadcode/orbit.git
cd orbit
npm install
npm start
```

## Development

### Requirements
- [Node.js v6.x.x](http://nodejs.org/)
- [npm v3.x.x](https://npmjs.com)
- g++, gcc, make (for building native modules)
- python 2 (for building, some native modules need it, node-fibers perhaps?)

### Get the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/haadcode/orbit.git
cd orbit/
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run Tests

*Note! Running the tests requires a running `redis-server`. If you don't have it installed, see installation instructions for [OSX](http://jasdeep.ca/2012/05/installing-redis-on-mac-os-x/) or [Linux](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)*

```
npm test
```

#### Browser app development

**NOTE!** *This is currently not working as described. We're working to fix it.*

```
cd client/
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open webpack dev-server at [http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server](http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server).

#### Build

```
cd client/
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create `client/dist` directory which contains all the files needed to distribute the Orbit browser application.

### Desktop app development

First, start the desktop app in developer mode:

```
npm run dev:electron
```

Then, start the UI development environment:

```
cd client/
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Build

*Run this is in project's root directory, not in `client/`.*

```
npm run build
```

The builds are in `dist/`.

## API

*We're in the process of separating the core orbit code into its own module and it'll make it possible to use the Orbit API to develop other clients and program using orbit.*

See [API documentation](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/blob/master/API.md) for full details.
